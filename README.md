> A NixOS UX subsystem for unified desktop appearance and behavior.

Vogix is a declarative UX layer for NixOS that unifies desktop configuration - define your appearance (colors, fonts, transparency, animations) and behavior (keybindings, window rules, gestures) once, and vogix generates configs for all your applications.

**Currently implemented:** Runtime color theme switching across 4 schemes without system rebuilds.

**Vision:** Full desktop UX management - see [roadmap](#roadmap).

## Roadmap

Vogix is evolving from a color theming tool to a full NixOS UX subsystem. See [#149](https://github.com/i-am-logger/vogix/issues/149) for the complete vision.

### Appearance (how things look)
- [x] Colors - runtime theme switching
- [ ] [Typography](https://github.com/i-am-logger/vogix/issues/141) - fonts, sizes, weights
- [ ] [Transparency](https://github.com/i-am-logger/vogix/issues/142) - opacity, blur
- [ ] [Backgrounds](https://github.com/i-am-logger/vogix/issues/143) - wallpapers
- [ ] [Window chrome](https://github.com/i-am-logger/vogix/issues/144) - borders, gaps, radius
- [ ] [Animations](https://github.com/i-am-logger/vogix/issues/151) - duration, easing
- [ ] [Cursors](https://github.com/i-am-logger/vogix/issues/146) - theme, size
- [ ] [Icons](https://github.com/i-am-logger/vogix/issues/152) - icon themes
- [ ] [Notifications](https://github.com/i-am-logger/vogix/issues/150) - mako, dunst styling
- [ ] [GTK/Qt](https://github.com/i-am-logger/vogix/issues/148) - toolkit theming
- [ ] [HiDPI](https://github.com/i-am-logger/vogix/issues/153) - scaling
- [ ] [Shaders](https://github.com/i-am-logger/vogix/issues/145) - CRT, bloom effects

### Behavior (how things act)
- [ ] [Keybindings](https://github.com/i-am-logger/vogix/issues/154) - unified across apps
- [ ] [Window rules](https://github.com/i-am-logger/vogix/issues/155) - floating, positioning
- [ ] [Focus](https://github.com/i-am-logger/vogix/issues/156) - follow mouse, click-to-focus
- [ ] [Gestures](https://github.com/i-am-logger/vogix/issues/157) - touchpad, touchscreen

## Philosophy

**Declarative.** Define your desktop experience once in a single config. Vogix generates the app-specific configs.

**Reproducible.** Built on Nix. Same inputs = same outputs. Templates are immutable in the Nix store, rendering is deterministic.

**Compositor-agnostic.** Works with Hyprland, Sway, i3, and others. Define your UX, vogix handles the translation.

## Color Schemes

Vogix supports 4 color schemes, each with its own philosophy:

| Scheme | Themes | Philosophy |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **vogix16** | 19 | Semantic design - colors convey functional meaning. See [design system](https://github.com/i-am-logger/vogix16-themes/blob/main/docs/design-system.md). |
| **base16** | ~300 | Minimal palette standard for syntax highlighting |
| **base24** | ~180 | Extended base16 with extra accents |
| **ansi16** | ~450 | Traditional ANSI terminal color mappings |

## Features

- **Multi-Scheme Support**: 4 color schemes (vogix16, ansi16, base16, base24)
  - **vogix16** (default) - Semantic design system focused on functional colors (19 native themes)
  - **ansi16** - Terminal ANSI standard (~450 themes)
  - **base16** - Minimal palette standard, widely used for UI and syntax highlighting (~300 themes)
  - **base24** - Expanded base16 palette with extra accents (~180 themes)
- **Runtime Theme Switching**: Change themes without NixOS rebuilds
- **Multi-Variant Themes**: Themes can have multiple variants (e.g., catppuccin: latte, frappe, macchiato, mocha)
- **Polarity Navigation**: Switch between lighter/darker variants with `vogix -v lighter` / `vogix -v darker`
- **Application-Specific Configs**: Direct integration for [supported applications](https://github.com/i-am-logger/vogix/tree/master/nix/modules/applications)
- **Multiple Reload Methods**: DBus, Unix signals, Sway IPC, filesystem watching
- **Nix-Based Theme Generation**: All theme configurations pre-generated at build time
- **NixOS Integration**: Home Manager module with systemd service
- **Shell Completions**: Support for Bash, Zsh, Fish, and Elvish

## Quick Start

### Installation (NixOS with Flakes)

Add to your `flake.nix`:

```nix
{
  inputs.vogix.url = "github:i-am-logger/vogix";

  outputs = { nixpkgs, home-manager, vogix, ... }: {
    homeConfigurations.youruser = home-manager.lib.homeManagerConfiguration {
      modules = [
        vogix.homeManagerModules.default
        {
          # Enable applications you want to theme
          programs.alacritty.enable = true;
          programs.btop.enable = true;

          # Configure vogix
          programs.vogix = {
            enable = true;
            defaultScheme = "vogix16";
            defaultTheme = "aikido";
            defaultVariant = "dark";
          };
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

### Usage

```bash
# Show current theme state
vogix status

# List all schemes with theme counts
vogix list

# List themes in a specific scheme
vogix list -s base16

# Set scheme, theme, and variant
vogix -s base16 -t catppuccin -v mocha

# Navigate to a darker variant
vogix -v darker

# Navigate to a lighter variant
vogix -v lighter

# Switch to default dark/light variant
vogix -v dark
vogix -v light

# Generate shell completions
vogix completions bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/vogix
```

## Testing

Vogix includes automated integration tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
./test.sh

# Or use nix directly
nix flake check
```

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for detailed testing documentation.

## Defaults

Vogix ships with the vogix16 scheme as the default, using the `aikido` theme in `dark` mode unless configured otherwise.

## Example Themes

Vogix supports themes from multiple sources:

- **vogix16**: Native themes from [vogix16-themes](https://github.com/i-am-logger/vogix16-themes) (aikido, forest, etc.)
- **ansi16**: Imported from [iTerm2-Color-Schemes](https://github.com/i-am-logger/iTerm2-Color-Schemes)
- **base16/base24**: Imported from [tinted-schemes](https://github.com/i-am-logger/tinted-schemes) (catppuccin, dracula, gruvbox, nord, etc.)

Create custom vogix16 themes by following the [vogix16-themes contribution guide](https://github.com/i-am-logger/vogix16-themes#contributing).


## Requirements

- NixOS (for full integration) or any Linux distribution (for standalone binary)
- Rust Edition 2024
