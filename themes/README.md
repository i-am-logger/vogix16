## Creating Custom Themes

To create your own Vogix16 theme, follow these guidelines:

1. Start with a monochromatic base (base00-base07)
2. Assign functional colors (base08-base0F) based on semantic purpose
3. Ensure both dark and light variants maintain the same semantic meaning

Remember that Vogix16 allows for creative use of colors as long as their functional purpose remains clear and consistent.
